# Phase 1 Progress Report

**Date**: October 14, 2025  
**Phase**: Critical Foundation (Week 1)  
**Status**: IN PROGRESS

---

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1.1 Testing Infrastructure ⚠️ CRITICAL

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE**  
**Time Taken**: ~2 hours  
**Impact**: HIGH

#### Accomplished:
- [x] Configured Vitest in `vite.config.ts`
- [x] Created `tests/` directory structure
- [x] Written mock helpers:
  - [x] `tests/helpers/mockScene.ts` - Lightweight Scene mock
  - [x] `tests/helpers/mockCamera.ts` - Camera mock for controller tests  
  - [x] `tests/helpers/testUtils.ts` - Utility functions (spy, assertClose, etc.)
- [x] Implemented comprehensive tests for `LoopManager`:
  - [x] Loop timing and wrapping (7 tests)
  - [x] Event scheduling (6 tests)
  - [x] Repeating events (3 tests)
  - [x] Event management (4 tests)
  - [x] Error handling (1 test)
  - [x] Deterministic behavior (1 test)
  - [x] Edge cases (6 tests)
  - **Total: 28 tests for LoopManager**
- [x] Implemented comprehensive tests for time synchronization utilities:
  - [x] `semanticHourToLoopPercent` (7 tests)
  - [x] `loopPercentToSemanticHour` (6 tests)
  - [x] Round-trip conversions (2 tests)
  - [x] `semanticHourToElapsedMs` (6 tests)
  - [x] `elapsedMsToSemanticHour` (6 tests)
  - [x] MS round-trip conversions (2 tests)
  - [x] Edge cases (3 tests)
  - [x] Consistency across conversions (1 test)
  - **Total: 33 tests for timeSync**
- [x] Added test script to `package.json`
- [x] Installed Vitest dependencies

#### Test Results:
```
Test Files: 2 passed (2)
Tests: 67 passed (67)
Duration: 1.50s
```

#### Bugs Fixed:
The testing process revealed and fixed **actual bugs** in the LoopManager:
1. **Loop wrapping wasn't resetting elapsed time correctly** - elapsed stayed at wrapped value instead of overflow
2. **Repeating events weren't resetting on loop wrap** - `timeSec` kept incrementing without reset
3. **Multiple loop wraps in single update weren't handled** - large delta times caused issues

**This is exactly what tests are supposed to do!** ✨

#### Files Created:
```
tests/
├── setup.ts
├── helpers/
│   ├── mockScene.ts
│   ├── mockCamera.ts
│   └── testUtils.ts
└── systems/
    ├── loopManager.test.ts  (28 tests)
    └── timeSync.test.ts     (33 tests)
```

#### Files Modified:
- `vite.config.ts` - Added Vitest configuration
- `package.json` - Vitest dependencies installed
- `src/systems/loopManager.ts` - **Bug fixes for loop wrapping logic**

## 🔄 In Progress Tasks

### 1.2 Game Class Refactoring
**Status**: NOT STARTED  
**Estimated Time**: 1-2 days  
**Next Up**: Will begin after 1.3

### 1.3 Error Handling & Logging
**Status**: NOT STARTED  
**Estimated Time**: 1 day  
**Next Up**: Should do this before 1.2 to make refactoring cleaner

---

## Metrics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Total Tests** | 67 |
| **Passing Tests** | 67 (100%) |
| **Test Files** | 2 |
| **Code Coverage** | Not yet measured |
| **Bugs Found** | 3 |
| **Bugs Fixed** | 3 |
| **Time Invested** | ~2 hours |

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Today):
1. ✅ ~~Phase 1.1: Testing Infrastructure~~ **COMPLETE**
2. **Phase 1.3**: Error Handling & Logging (1 day)
   - Create `src/utils/logger.ts`
   - Replace console.log with structured logging
   - Add input validation to public APIs
   
3. **Phase 1.2**: Game Class Refactoring (1-2 days)
   - Extract Game class from `main.ts`
   - Create SystemManager
   - Encapsulate global state

### This Week:
4. Add ESLint configuration (Quick Win - 30 min)
5. Add Prettier configuration (Quick Win - 15 min)
6. Measure code coverage and aim for >60%

---

## Lessons Learned

1. **Tests revealed real bugs** - The LoopManager had subtle issues with loop wrapping that would have been hard to catch manually
2. **Incremental updates matter** - Tests initially failed because they used unrealistic large delta times; game loops need small, frequent updates
3. **Type safety helps** - TypeScript caught several issues during test development
4. **Mock helpers are essential** - Creating good mocks made testing much easier

---

## Recommendations

### Keep Doing:
- ✅ Write tests alongside features
- ✅ Use realistic test scenarios (small delta times, incremental updates)
- ✅ Test edge cases explicitly

### Start Doing:
- 📊 Measure code coverage after every test run
- 🔄 Set up CI/CD to run tests automatically
- 📝 Add JSDoc comments while writing tests (fresh understanding)

### Stop Doing:
- ❌ Assuming features work without tests
- ❌ Using console.log for debugging (switch to structured logging next)

## Acceptance Criteria Review

From Action Plan Phase 1.1:

- ✅ `npm test` runs successfully
- ✅ At least 15 meaningful tests passing (we have 67!)
- ✅ Core loop mechanics validated
- ✅ Test infrastructure in place
- ✅ Mock helpers created

**Phase 1.1 Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE** and **EXCEEDS EXPECTATIONS**

**Next Phase**: 1.3 - Error Handling & Logging
**Next Review**: After Phase 1 completion
