## Creative Directions — Surreal / Wacky / Off-the-Wall

This section leans hard into surrealism and strange, memorable beats. Think David Lynch meets a blocky, lo-fi town where clocks bleed and streetlamps hum lullabies. The goal is to make the town feel dreamlike: familiar, but wrong in small ways that compound into a deeply unsettling, funny, and intriguing mystery.

- Tone & Vibe:
	- Surreal, half-comedic, half-melancholic. The town is absurd but emotionally resonant.
	- Visuals are lo-fi, blocky (Minecraft-like) but with impossible geometry occasionally (a staircase that ends at the sky, doors that open to other streets).
	- Sound design is weirdly melodic: distant muzak that skips, murmured radio broadcasts repeating fragments, ambient clocks with slightly different tempos.


## Characters (starter list — at least 10)
- Rahul (player): Private eye, world-weary, camera-obsessed, struggling alcoholic. He carries a battered Polaroid camera that unexpectedly anchors his memory of loops. His drinking causes blackouts that the inter-dimensional presence exploits; his sobriety offers clarity but limited access to the "folds." He wears a blue hawaiian shirt with white flowers and loves drinking and driving.

- Mayor Pippin: Smiling mayor whose grin glitches at midnight; loves parades that never quite start.
- The Baker (Mina): An anxious baker who sells "time pies"—tarts that cause customers to briefly relive a childhood memory.
- The Clocksmith (Old Jory): Repairs clocks and mutters about commas in time. He talks about "folds" and visitors between days — speaks in riddles and keeps odd maps of the sky.
- The Librarian (Etta): Keeps an impossible shelf of newspapers that print the day's headlines only after the events happen.
- The Florist (Iris): Grows flowers that point toward truths—petal directions shift after crimes.
- The Night Bus Driver (Gareth): Drives a bus that loops the town but occasionally takes people to the wrong era for a minute.
- The Mute Street Artist (K): Paints murals that move when you aren't looking.
- The Gardener (Ms. Voss): Plants topiaries that subtly change shape each morning.
- The Confectioner (Mr. Pudd): Makes candy that makes people confess truths while under its influence.
- Optional cameo suspects: A tourist in a fish-suit, a stray cat that disappears at noon, a phantom mailman who only delivers letters to empty houses.

## Why the Loop? (The Conspiracy)

Beneath the town's ordinary face is a shadowed circle called the "New Dawn Fellowship." To the public it's a quiet support group; in reality the Fellowship runs invitation-only late-night rituals at the derelict church, and most of the town either doesn't know they happen or has been encouraged to look the other way.

Important clarifications and beats:
- The meetings are secret. They aren't open to the public or listed on a noticeboard — attendance is by invitation, code-phrases, and small favors. Rahul must actively discover that they exist (tailing members, finding burned pamphlets, intercepting whispered invitations).
- Cult members use a series of underground tunnels to access the church basement where rituals take place
- Cult members have only one day to ressurect Baezelbub, so they are using black magic to make the day loop until they are able to get the summoning spell correct. 
- Fellowship members actively mislead outsiders. When Rahul asks obvious questions, townsfolk give half-truths, false leads, or steer him into dead ends to protect the ritual rhythm. A few complicit members will plant red herrings that frame innocent people or point Rahul toward harmless, staged incidents.
- The cult treats repetition as currency. Rituals, hymns, and the pouring of spirits are repeated with ritual precision; those repetitions are what the inter-dimensional presence anchors to. The Fellowship engineers predictable human patterns — and then uses those patterns to bargain with the presence.
- The leader (Brother March) is smooth and persuasive and is actually The Mute Street Artist.

How the crimes tie in:
- The small, puzzling crimes Rahul will photograph are not random: many are committed by cult members as tasks ordered by the Fellowship. A shop 'theft' might be a staged exchange, a smashed trophy might be ritual vandalism, and a missing person could be quietly relocated for a meeting. These acts train the town's narrative flow and escalate toward a major ritual.
- Solving the small crimes reveals the chain: identify who benefits from each staged incident, and the trail leads back toward Fellowship favors, meeting times, and the anchor object.

Gameplay and investigative hooks (revised):
- Discover secrecy: find invitation scraps, decode ciphered hymn lines, follow a member after dark to get an invitation.
- Uncover deception: collect contradictions (an alibi that changes, two witnesses who disagree, a planted piece of evidence) and force suspects to reveal who ordered the action.
- Pressure the network: use photos as leverage to blackmail or expose low-level members, causing cracks in the Fellowship and new, unpredictable loop behavior.
- High stakes: being seen snooping or confronting a member can get Rahul publicly accused; the cult will try to discredit him and steer him away from core evidence.

This rewrite makes the conspiracy active and stealthy: the threat is human organization as much as inter-dimensional hunger. It centers Rahul as an outsider the cult wants regularized — and frames each solved petty crime as a step toward exposing the hidden ritual that keeps the loop alive.

## 10 Buildings & Signature Details
 - Town Square / The Folded Hour Bar — central plaza; near the steps to an old bar called "The Folded Hour" (where the anchor flask/jukebox was found). The plaza is otherwise normal but small anomalies concentrate near the bar (a fountain that sometimes seems to run backward, a lamppost that hums faintly).
- Mayor's Office / Parade Grounds — overly cheerful, with a trophy room full of identical trophies dated to impossible years.
- Mina's Bakery — scent cues, time-pie mechanics, pastry-based side clues.
- Jory's Clockshop — gears visible through glass, the NPC with clockwork models that whisper.
- Etta's Library — rotating stacks, newspapers that print future/past headlines.
- Iris's Flower Boutique — living petals, bouquets that act as simple directional indicators to clues.
- Bus Depot / Night Bus — routes that change each loop; graffiti that updates itself.
- K's Alley / Mural Lane — murals animate and can hide QR-like patterns that reveal clues when photographed.
- Ms. Voss's Greenhouse — topiaries shaped like suspects; trimming them changes the suspect's behavior slightly.
- Mr. Pudd's Candy Shoppe — confession candies, wrappers with secret notes.

## Daily Beats & Example Crimes (one loop = 20 minutes; split 10/10 day/night)
The goal is to design 4–6 small incidents per day that interconnect. Each day one of them escalates into a crime Rahul must photograph.

- Example Sequence:
	1. 08:00 — Bus driver drops off a passenger wearing a paper mask; they leave a paper scrap.
	2. 09:30 — Baker sells a time-pie to the mayor; the mayor's mood shifts to melancholic.
	3. 11:00 — A mural is painted overnight that shows a silhouette pointing toward the fountain.
	4. 13:00 — Librarian receives a newspaper with a headline about a theft that hasn't happened yet.
	5. 15:00 — The florist's top bouquet wilts and points to an alley; a witness mentions seeing a strange shadow.
	6. 19:00 — A genuine crime occurs (theft, staged kidnapping, or the mayor's trophy smashed).

Each crime is staged by the artifact (or the entity using it) to create narrative. The real culprit might be an NPC, or the artifact itself manipulating people.

## Clue Types & How They Work
- Photographs: Primary evidence. The camera records anomalies visible only on film (ghost-lights, future/past imprints). Photos can be zoomed and developed in a small darkroom UI.
- Audio Clips: Rahul can record snippets with a tape recorder — eavesdrop at a bus stop or during conversations. Playbacks sometimes overlap with other days' audio.
- Written Notes: Diaries, wrapper notes, library slips. Some are encrypted; Rahul can assemble fragments across loops.
- Environmental Cues: Footprints that fade into stanzas, shifted topiaries, spilled flour forming a symbol.
- Living Clues: Flowers that point, murals that animate, candy-induced confessions.

## Mechanics Tied to Narrative
 - Memory Polaroid: Rahul wakes with a single Polaroid (or a shaky mental flash) showing a moment he missed; it changes every loop and hints which event is the pivot. The Polaroid is the strange artifact born of his camera + blackout — it ties his memory to the loop but also gives him actionable clues.
- Photo Development: The player must take a photo and bring it to a small darkroom (or use camera UI) to reveal hidden details. Some photos require multiple exposures across loops to reveal a full clue.
- NPC Schedules: Each NPC has routine waypoints. Some events only occur if Rahul has previously interfered (e.g., leaves a note) in an earlier loop.
 - Intoxication & Reset: Rahul's intoxication level is a gameplay variable. Drinking raises it (blurred vision, shaky aim, unreliable controls, but access to "folded" or inter-dimensional moments); sobriety yields clearer controls and more reliable memory but reduces the being's direct influence. Sleeping still resets the loop after 12 in-game hours, but Rahul's drinking choices change which events he can witness. Save/load allows branching investigations — you can return to a past save to try different approaches.

## Major Story Beats (3-act sketch)
 - Act 1 — Awaken: Rahul wakes looping, discovers his Polaroid and learns to photograph anomalies. He uncovers small crimes and oddities tied to the bar and the anchor object. Early on he must confront how his drinking both obscures and reveals the truth.
- Act 2 — Deepen: Evidence reveals an inter-dimensional presence experimenting with narrative — the town's days show repeated, slightly shifted patterns. NPCs begin to have looping memories and conflicting accounts; Rahul stitches them together.
 - Act 3 — Confront: Rahul must expose the presence's experiment by staging a final, true narrative — a photograph or sequence of actions that captures the being's abuse of his blackouts and shows the town the pattern. Endings can vary: destroy the anchor (flask/jukebox) and sober up, accept the loop and become its chronicler, or deliberately choose sobriety and lose the loop-memory (a bittersweet, human ending).

## Visual & Audio Direction
- Visual: Blocky low-poly models, saturated pastel palette with occasional harsh neon for unnatural elements. Use subtle geometry warps for surreal moments.
- Audio: Lo-fi synth loops, distorted muzak, clock ticks offset by micro-tempo changes. Use voice fragments and whispered headlines.

## Creative Todo (concrete items to implement conceptually)
- Write 12 Polaroid hint templates and where/when they can appear.
- Draft 10 NPC bios with secrets and daily schedules (waypoints + key times).
- Design 6–8 crimes/incidents with escalation paths.
- Create 10 building descriptions + interaction hooks (e.g., bring a pie to the mayor).
- Design camera UI mockups (photo reticle, film count, development screen).
- Write 3–4 alternate endings and branching conditions.
- Create a short sample loop script (20 minutes) containing timed events and triggers for testing.
